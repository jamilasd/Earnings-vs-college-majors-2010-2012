# Earnings-vs-college-majors-2010-2012

**Introduction:** In this project, I explored how earnings varied depending by college major. I worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors) cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo, where I obtained the data.

Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more. The most important columns in the dataset are listed in a table in the jupyter file.

A few of the questions I answered during the process were:
- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
- Which category of majors have the most students?

**How to run the project:**
1. Download the .csv file to your desktop (or any other easily accesible folder).
2. Download the .ipynb (Jupyter) file to the same folder as above.
3. Reset and run all of the cells in the Jupyter file.
